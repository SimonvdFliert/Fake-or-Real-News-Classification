# True or Fake News
 A text classification project analysing a dataset containing True or Fake news


This project uses the data from Kaggle's [Fake News Detector](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfoluna/fake-news-detector). The csv's can be found in the Data folder. **Note that this project also uses GloVe's embedding**. Specifically, the embeddings file "glove.6b.100d.txt" is used by the implemented Convolutional Neural Network. This document can be downloaded [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

This project is made to get a better understanding of natural language processing, in particular with the preprocessing of textual data and implementing deep learning methods to classify between real and fake news. Several algorithms are implemented:

1. SVM
2. Logistic Regression
3. Convolutional Neural Network
